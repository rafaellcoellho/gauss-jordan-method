# Gauss-jordan Method 

This program implement the gauss-jordan method for solving system of linear equations. This is part of an exercise from numerical analysis class.

```
 Gauss-jordan method is the process of performing row operations to transform any matrix into (reduced) row echelon form. In reduced row echelon form, each successive row of the matrix has less dependencies than the previous, so solving systems of equations is a much easier task. 
```

## How to build and run

Build with make:

```
$ make
```
Run:

```
$ ./gauss-jordan-method
```

### Input

One augmented matrix of a linear system
